# NimaCam for Brilliant-Frame
 This is a simple camera app for the Brilliant Frame smartglasses written in Python. The app plays an intro describing itself, allows the user to tap to trigger a capture, and after capture is complete, prompts the user to tap to quit the app and clear the Frame's display.
